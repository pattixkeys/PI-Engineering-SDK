        <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This Software Development Kit (SDK) is intended to allow software developers 
      direct access to P.I. Engineering devices. It allows bi-directional control 
      for features such as backlighting or control of displays. The products supported 
      by this kit include are those that are currently in production and recommended 
      for new designs. For older legacy products not found in this kit please 
      refer to the Legacy SDKs found at <a href="http://x-keys.com" target="_blank">X-keys.com</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>P.I. Engineering SDK provides the necessary files and sample code to use 
      the P.I. Engineering PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll and PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll/PIEHidNetCore.dll 
      class libraries. PieHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll is a traditional unmanaged dll. 
      PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll is a .NET class library*, an assembly with 
      equivalent functions to the PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll. These .dlls are used 
      to communicate with our USB devices allowing developers to incorporate P.I. 
      Engineering devices into their own applications. </p>
        
    <p>This development kit, also available at<a href="https://github.com/piengineering/PI-Engineering-SDK"> 
      https://github.com/piengineering/PI-Engineering-SDK</a>, contains a variety 
      of samples; C# .NET, VB.NET, C++, and Eclipse. All samples make use of the 
      PIEHid* functions (with the exception of Eclipse) directly as described 
      in the PIEHid Documentation section of this help file.&nbsp;While we provide 
      the PIEHid* dlls for ease of integration, it is by no means a requirement 
      to use our products. All of our products are standard USB HID protocol and 
      therefore any USB HID libraries can be used. One alternative is the <a href="https://github.com/IntergatedCircuits/HidSharp">HIDSharp 
      library</a>, a multiplatform C# library by James F. Bellinger.</p>
    <p>*Requires the Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 or higher installed.</p>
        
        <h3>Note for Non-PC Users:</h3>
    <p>All products conform to standard USB HID protocol and can be used on any 
      machine with a USB port. The data reports listed here can be used as reference, 
      however the PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll and PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll/PIEHidNetCore.dll 
      will only function on PC machines. Our Linux SDK is available at <a href="https://github.com/piengineering/X-keys_Linux">https://github.com/piengineering/X-keys_Linux</a>. 
      Android SDK is available at <a href="https://xkeys.com/software/developer/developerandroidsamples.html">https://xkeys.com/software/developer/developerandroidsamples.html</a>. 
      Mac OS X SDK is available at <a href="https://github.com/piengineering/XkeysOSX">https://github.com/piengineering/XkeysOSX</a>. 
      Please contact P.I. Engineering for further details.</p>
