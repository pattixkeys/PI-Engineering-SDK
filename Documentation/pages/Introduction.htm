      | <a href="../index.htm">Main Page</a></h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This Software Development Kit (SDK) is intended to allow software developers 
      direct access to P.I. Engineering devices. It allows bi-directional control 
      for features such as backlighting or control of displays. The products supported 
      by this kit include are those that are currently in production and recommended 
      for new designs. For older legacy products not found in this kit please 
      refer to the Legacy SDKs found at <a href="http://x-keys.com" target="_blank">X-keys.com</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>P.I. Engineering SDK provides the necessary files and sample code to use 
      the P.I. Engineering PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll and PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll. 
      PieHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll is a traditional unmanaged dll. PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll 
      is a .NET class library*, an assembly with equivalent functions to the PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll. 
      These .dlls are used to communicate with our USB devices allowing developers 
      to incorporate P.I. Engineering devices into their own applications. </p>
        
    <p>This development kit contains a variety of samples; C# .NET Express 2008, 
      VB.NET 2010, C++ 2010, and Eclipse. All samples make use of the PIEHid functions 
      (with the exception of Eclipse) directly as described in the PIEHid Documentation 
      section of this help file.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Several of our more popular products now have a .NET component available. 
      This allows programmers integrate their X-key device with an easy drag on 
      component from the Toolbox. The P.I. Engineering SDK installs the samples 
      and files needed to use the .NET component but the user must decide to install 
      the component. To install the component browse to the folder .../PI Engineering/PI 
      Engineering SDK/<i>product</i>/.NET Component/Install and double click on 
      the *.vscontent file. It will install the .NET component. After installation 
      the component will show up in the Toolbox in Visual Studio. Note the component 
      requires Visual Studio 2010 or higher and .NET Framework 4 or higher. Separate 
      documentation for the .NET component is available in the .../PI Engineering/PI 
      Engineering SDK/<i>product</i>/.NET Component folder. The .NET components 
      use PIEHid32Net.dll.</p>
    <p>*Requires the Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 or higher installed.</p>
        
        <h3>Note for Non-PC Users:</h3>
    <p>All products conform to standard USB protocol and can be used on any machine 
      with a USB port. The data reports listed here can be used as reference, 
      however the PIEHid32.dll/PIEHid64.dll and PIEHid32Net.dll/PIEHid64Net.dll 
      will only function on PC machines. Our Linux SDK is available at <a href="http://www.piengineering.com/PISupport/DeveloperLinuxSDK.php" target="_blank">http://www.piengineering.com/PISupport/DeveloperLinuxSDK.php</a>. 
      Android SDK is available at <a href="http://www.piengineering.com/PISupport/DeveloperAndroidSamples.php" target="_blank">http://www.piengineering.com/PISupport/DeveloperAndroidSamples.php</a>. 
      Mac OS X SDK is available at <a href="http://xkeys.com/PISupport/DeveloperMacSDK.php">http://xkeys.com/PISupport/DeveloperMacSDK.php</a>. 
      Please contact P.I. Engineering for further details.</p>
