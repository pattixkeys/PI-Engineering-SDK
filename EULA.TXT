Implied warranties on the Software Product, to the extent required by applicable law, are limited to ninety (90) days from the Purchase Date.

Your Remedy.

Your exclusive remedy for any breach of the Limited Warranty is for you to give us notice of the breach by returning to PI Engineering (at the address shown below) a copy of your purchase receipt for your copy of the Software Product and a description of the alleged breach, and then, at PI Engineering's option, PI Engineering shall either: (a) return the price you paid (if any) for the Software Product (at which time your rights under this EULA are deemed to have terminated); or (b) repair or replace the Software Product. The Limited Warranty period for any replacement Software Product will be extended for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days after the replacement Software Product is delivered to you, whichever is longer.
