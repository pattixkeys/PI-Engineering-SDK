.Net Component

The Windows SDK includes two different ways of communicating with the X-keys on Windows systems:

1) The traditional SDK where the developer uses calls to our unmanaged or managed (.NET) DLL to communicate with the device. Samples are included for C++, C#, and VB.NET. All modern X-keys devices are supported.

2) The new X-keys .NET Components, which include a simplified API that encapsulates much of the functionality of the standard SDK. Once installed in the Visual Studio environment, just drag-and-drop onto your form and support an X-keys device in mere minutes of development time. Samples are included for C# and VB.NET.
